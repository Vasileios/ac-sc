* History

The history of Algorithmic Composition traced back to
antiquity. Pythagoras found that maths can be tranlated to music and
through this ...

Primary principles of automated information
processing can already be found in the 13th century. Through the works of
Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace,
The history of algorithmic composition has its beginning
shortly after the turn of the first millennium with a system developed by Guido
of Arezzo enabling the generation of melodic material from texts, spans over the application
of algorithmic principles in the developing complex polyphony and is also
found in the “composition machines” of Athanasius Kircher in the Baroque period.
Furthermore, first applications of algorithms for compositional tasks can be found
in the popular “musical dice game” in the 18th century. (Nierhaus 2009)
