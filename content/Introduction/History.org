*** Chapter 1


* History

Music and maths.

*Pythagoras*

The sound of blacksmiths hammering had led Pythagoras to
important conclusions about the nature of pitch and the mathematical
basis of harmony after comparing the pitches made by hammers.

*Guido D'Arrezo*

Also in the context of algorithmic composition, by around AD 1000 a first approach to automatic musical structure genesis had been developed. Guido of Arezzo (around 991–1031) contributed considerably to the development of notation, developed solmization and was an important music theorist of the medieval era. One of his most significant works, “Micrologus,” is the earliest compendium of monodic and polyphonic singing practice.

*Ars Magna*

If the abovementioned principles represent the beginnings of
algorithmic manipulation of musical material, then the “Ars Magna”
of Raimundus Lullus effectively realizes the concept of a computer
(music) system.

*Kircher*

In his exhaustive musicologist work “Musurgia Universalis” from 1650,
Kircher developed amongst others a system of algorithmic
composition. This system consists of three categories of labeled
wooden sticks (syntagmas) on which both numbers and rhythmic values
are engraved.

*Leibniz (1646–1716)*

“universal language”

Formalization of the sciences.

..enable the solution of any scientific problem within a comprehensive
calculus.

The concept of a universal language was also a vision of
cross-national communication in Europe after the Thirty-Year War.

Programm's preconditions:

1. Precompile encyclopedia of all terms that are necessary to formalize the sciences;

2. a formal system was to be developed, namely the “lingua universalis,” within which all scientific terms could be coded;

3. creating the “calculus ratiocinator” that should enable the connection of all terms of the universal language by means of logical operations.


Use of symbols to represent all scientific terms.

As a set of symbols, he chose the group of natural numbers.

For example,

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Thing = 2
Being = 6=2*3
Human Being = 30=6*5
etc.
#+END_QUOTE

“Musica est exercitium arithmeticae occultum, nescientis se numerare animi” (“Music is a hidden arithmetic exercise of the soul, which does not know that it is counting.”).



 *Calculating process & machines*

A mechanization of calculating processes, 1617 by the Scottish
mathematician John Napier and Jost Bu ̈rgi (1552–1632) pioneered in the
field of logarithms with his “Mirifici logarithmorum canonis
descriptio” appearing in 1614, designed a device for multiplication
and division, based on the principle of the Pythagorean abacus. (1550–1617).

The Napier’s abacus, also known as Napier’s bones.

Similar to Napier's Bones:

Caspar Schott (1608–1666),
“Organum Mathematicum” (1668)

Leibniz’ idea of applying the binary numeral system to an automaton was realized by an invention in the textile industry. In the year 1725, Basile Bouchon developed the first system for an automatic control of looms.

*Babbage-Lovelace 18th century*

Babbage’s main objective was the mechanization of calculation processes such as those that are required for the generation of logarithm tables.

Alongside Babbage, Ada Countess of Lovelace (1815–1852) played an important role. She was a self-educated mathematician and worked together with Babbage on the concept of the “analytical engine.” In 1840, Babbage gave a course of lectures in Turin on his invention. On the basis of this material, the Italian mathematician Luigi Frederico Menabrea published the article “Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage” in 1842. Ada Lovelace translated this text to English in 1843 and added her own detailed considerations to the material, including the concepts of the loop, subroutine and the conditional jump. The Countess of Lovelace is considered to be the first female programmer in the history of informatics – the programming language Ada, developed in the 1970s, is named after her.

Furthermore, first applications of algorithms for compositional tasks can be found
in the popular “musical dice game” in the 18th century. (Nierhaus 2009)

*Logical Operations*

*Boole (1815-1864)*

George Boole (1815– 1864) developed in his publications “The Mathematical Analysis of Logic” (1847) and “An Investigation of the Laws of Thought” (1854) a formalism for the repre- sentation of propositional logic.

*Shannon (1916-2001)*
